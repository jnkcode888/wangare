   ```

2. **Send a test contact form** from your website
3. **Verify emails** are received at `info.wangareluxe@gmail.com`
4. **Update order confirmation** calls to use SMTP
5. **Remove EmailJS** once you're confident SMTP is working

## 📞 **Support:**

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the admin panel for error messages
2. Verify your Gmail app password is correct
3. Ensure 2-factor authentication is enabled on Gmail
4. Check Gmail's "Less secure app access" settings
